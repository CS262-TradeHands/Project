# Vision Statement

## TradeHands

Ten thousand baby boomers retire each day[^1] and over two-thirds of small business owners are projected to retire in the next two years.[^2] Companies struggle to find suitable successors, leading to the ultimate demise of many businesses. Business brokerages have filled stepped up in the past to help, but their lack of relationship building and limited support leaves businesses wanting more. The solution? TradeHands: a utility-oriented software created for brokers that connects retiring business owners with aspiring entrepreneurs based on their field of interest, expected buy-out periods, and experience level. Unlike platforms like Flippa and EmpireFlippers - which rely on impersonal, fully online transactions, TradeHands acts as a hands-on broker providing personalized administrative, financial, and legal support. Focused on West Michigan’s local business community, TradeHands fosters genuine offline relationships between retirees and entrepreneurs, ensuring smooth and sustainable business transitions.

At the core of our platform is an intelligent matching algorithm that pairs users based on their industry, buyout timeline, and experience level. After matching, the app guides both parties through every step—from paperwork to secure transaction—ensuring trust, transparency, and efficiency. Altogether, this gives TradeHands an edge in breaking into the entrepreneurial ecosystem, providing relief for the largest business transition period of our time.
