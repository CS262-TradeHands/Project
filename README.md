# Vision Statement

## TradeHands

Ten thousand baby boomers retire each day[^1] and over two-thirds of small business owners are projected to retire in the next two years.[^2] Companies struggle to find suitable successors, leading to the ultimate demise of many businesses. The solution? TradeHands: an app that connects retiring business owners with aspiring entrepreneurs based on their field of interest, expected buy-out periods, and mentorship. Similar platforms in this space such as Flippa and EmpireFlippers are constrained to the digital sector, leaving space in the market for TradeHands. While physical platforms do exist, like BizBuySell, TradeHands will have the unique value of cultivating mentorship and establishing a standard buyout system, offering additional support for both buyers and sellers. The specific demographic focus here allows retirees and entrepreneurs to connect directly and manage the hand-off on their own terms, unlike the existing services.

The key feature in our application is an account-matching algorithm based on an onboarding survey completed by mentors and mentees. Other primary features include messaging between the two parties, a scheduling assistant linked to an external calendar, and a learning hub filled with resources to aid both members of the partnership. Further development would include additional language options, business financial condition validation, and contact sharing through Bluetooth device connection. Altogether, this gives TradeHands an edge in breaking into the entrepreneurial ecosystem, providing relief for the largest business transition period of our time.
