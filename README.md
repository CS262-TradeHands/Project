# Vision Statement

## TradeHands

Ten thousand baby boomers retire each day[^1] and over two-thirds of small business owners are projected to retire in the next two years.[^2] Companies struggle to find suitable successors, leading to the ultimate demise of many businesses. Business brokerages have  stepped up in the past to help, but their lack of relationship building and limited support leave businesses wanting more. The solution? TradeHands: a utility-oriented software created for brokers that connects retiring business owners with aspiring entrepreneurs based on their field of interest, expected buy-out periods, and experience level. Unlike platforms like Flippa and EmpireFlippers - which rely on impersonal, fully online transactions, TradeHands acts as a hands-on broker providing personalized administrative, financial, and legal support. Focused on West Michigan’s local business community, TradeHands fosters genuine offline relationships between retirees and entrepreneurs, ensuring smooth and sustainable business transitions.

The key feature in our application is an account-matching algorithm based on an onboarding survey completed by mentors and mentees. Users enter the interface through an immersive animation and are brought to a listings page that is seperated by businesses and buyers. Prominent details are censored to encourage users to complete the one-of-a-kind onboarding form that utilizes the account-matching algorithm to present customized matches. Further development would include additional language options, business financial condition validation, and contact sharing through Bluetooth device connection. Altogether, this gives TradeHands an edge in breaking into the entrepreneurial ecosystem, providing relief for the largest business transition period of our time.
